--Thank you for purchasing The Launcher by Çaðlayan Karagözler!

UPDATE: In order to force the game executable to be launched only by the launcher, copy "ForceLauncher.cs" to your game project and add it to any Game Object on scene.

It's pretty easy to use, many fields are self-explanatory 
but for detailed info on how to use it and how it works;

**The Launcher** 

	is a helper application like any patcher but with one difference; 
It’s completely coded and designed in Unity. It basically allows the
user to download your game, keeps your game updated at all times and
checks file integrity.

	It has two main parts. The uploader and the client. The uploader works
in the Unity Editor and is launched from “Window” menu by clicking its name.
The client is delivered to the player.

	The Uploader, allows you to select your build, compresses the build
folder and uploads it to a server you specify via FTP protocol right from the
Unity Editor.

	The Client, allows your player to download the compressed build from
the server and decompresses it while also checking the file integrity and
latest version. Client requests the files via HTTP. It also launches your game
through its interface.

Check the documentation for more information.
